## Welcome to the Intigi API documentation

Follow these steps to get started with the Intigi API:

2. Set up your *Interests* and *Sources* in the Intigi web app.
3. Use the Intigi API to get a list of your [Interest Folders and Interests](/resources/interest_folders_and_interests.html) in JSON format.
4. Use the Intigi API to get [Recommendations](/resources/recommendations.html) in JSON format.

### API highlights

* API type: REST (JSON via HTTPS).
* [Authentication](/api-authentication.html): Via HTTP Basic Authentication.
* Pricing: We charge per API request. See our [API pricing](https://intigi.com/api) page for details.
* Security: All requests are performed via SSL. We properly encrypt all credentials. We filter passwords so they never get stored in our server logs. Our firewalls are locked down tightly.
* Rate limits: This is up to you since we charge for every request. We consider 1-50 requests per day and Interest reasonable.
